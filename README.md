# Shush ðŸ¤«
This simple program will help you run [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) algorithm on a file that you provide, generating base64 encoded "shards" that can be re-combined with the same tool to recover the message.

## Building & Installing
```bash
# On a unix-based system with go installed...
go build -o shush main.go
# install on your system
mv shush /usr/local/bin
```
## Usage
To generate shards for a _3 of 5_ configuration:

```bash
shush encrypt -t=3 -s=5 "secret.txt"
```

Which will write the following shards:
```
secret.txt.shard0
secret.txt.shard1
secret.txt.shard2
secret.txt.shard3
secret.txt.shard4
```

To recombine the shards generated by the previous command, and output the secret in `secret-recovered.txt`:

```bash
# Note the * which will pick up all of the numbered shards.
shush decrypt "secret.txt.shard*"
```
